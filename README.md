# bcalc

A calculator written in pure bash.

I even managed to write a lexer for the argument input, allowing you to do `1+1` instead of `1 + 1`.

I made sure to thouroughly comment the script, feel free to check it out if you're interested!


## What's supported

- Basic math operations
- Whole numbers

## TODO

- Fix a problem with the lexer assigning all numbers to the first number array (very important)
- Support PEMDAS
- Support decimals
