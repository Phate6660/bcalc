# bcalc

A calculator written in pure bash.

I even managed to write a lexer for the argument input, allowing you to do `1+1` instead of `1 + 1`.

I made sure to thouroughly comment the script, feel free to check it out if you're interested!


## What's supported

- Basic math operations
- Whole numbers

## TODO

- Better formatted ouput (perhaps `1,000,000` instead of `1000000` for example)
- Support PEMDAS
- Support decimals

Off-topic from this calculator:

I feel like the work I would put into the lexer for this calculator,<br>
can be adapted into a framework for creating custom languages in BASH.

I'm definitely going to look into this after I've done more work on the calculator.
