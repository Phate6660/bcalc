# bcalc

A calculator written in pure bash.

I even managed to write a lexer for the argument input, allowing you to do `1+1` instead of `1 + 1`.

I made sure to thouroughly comment the script, feel free to check it out if you're interested!

Currently it support multiplication, division, addition, and substraction.

Currently it only works with whole numbers as well, I'll have to add support for decimals.
